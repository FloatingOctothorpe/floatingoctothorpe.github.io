<h1>Building a NAS: part 1</h1>

<time datetime="2020-04-21">21 April 2020</time>

<p>For a long time my backup strategy has roughly followed the <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html">strategy suggested
by Jamie Zawinski</a>. For the most part this has been great, and
there are certainly times when I've been glad I've had a backup! However
managing files across multiple devices and keeping them in sync has always
been slightly awkward. Previously I also used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt">TrueCrypt</a> to
encrypt by backups, however this is no longer supported.</p>
<p>To fix this I'm planning to build a DIY <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> so I can sort and
backup my files.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Ideally I would like to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Snapshots</strong>: create regular snapshots so I can quickly restore deleted
   files if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mirroring</strong>: all data should be mirrored to a second disk so data can
   survive a single disk failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run headless</strong>: I'm planning to keep the NAS in the cupboard under the
   stairs, so I want to be able to control it remotely (e.g. over SSH) without
   needing a monitor attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong>: use full disk encryption to protect the confidentiality of
   data stored on the NAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: to keep costs down the NAS should be low power, and ideally reuse
   existing hardware I have access to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backups</strong>: backup data to external drives, ideally automatically when a
   backup drive is attached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>I'm planning to use the following hardware for the NAS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HP MicroServer G7 (N54L)</strong>: my brother kindly gave me his old HP
   MicroServer. The AMD CPU (AMD Turionâ„¢II Neo N54L (2.2GHz)) is pretty dated
   by modern standards; however the system uses just under 50W at idle and
   should be enough for a basic NAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40GB SSD</strong>: I'm planning to repurpose an old SSD to install the operating
   system on. This should hopefully be more reliable than installing onto a USB
   drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4TB HDDs</strong>: I currently have two 4TB hard drives which will be used to
   hold my data. Depending on how quickly my snapshots grow I might look to
   upgrade these in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>External drives</strong>: I have several external drives to use for backups. My
   only concern is the lack of USB 3.0 on the MicroServer will limit transfer
   speeds significantly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Operating system</h3>
<p>When it comes to building a DIY NAS, <a href="https://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> is one of the
first operating systems that comes to mind. While FreeNAS would be a fairly
good fit, I'm more familiar with Linux, and will likely use the NAS to host
other services (e.g. a <a href="/2017/getting-started-with-radicale.html">Radicale</a> calendar).</p>
<p>I'm also keen to avoid having to regularly re-install the OS, this narrowed my
choice of distros down to distros with long support windows like Debian or
CentOS.</p>
<h3>Filesystem</h3>
<p>One of my goals is to set up regular automatic snapshots. While this can be
done in software, using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_computer_storage">copy on write filesystem</a> is in my
opinion a more elegant solution. There are two well used copy on write
filesystems available for Linux, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a>.</p>
<p>In theory Btrfs would be fine for my use case, however I'm slightly concerned
for it's future given Red Hat recently <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_8/file-systems-and-storage_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-8#btrfs-has-been-removed_file-systems-and-storage">dropped support for it in RHEL
8</a>. ZFS has been around for nearly 15 years now, and while there
are some <a href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing/zfs-and-linux">legal complications</a>, this hasn't stopped Ubuntu shipping
ZFS since 16.04.</p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>To protect my data at rest I want to use full disk encryption on both the OS
disk, and on the data disks. For the OS disk, I'm planning to use LUKS; however
for the data disks, ZFS actually supports native encryption. Unfortunately this
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zfs-linux/+bug/1751671">feature isn't available</a> in the current long term support
(LTS) release of Ubuntu (18.04). Thankfully the next LTS release of Ubuntu
(20.04 Focal Fossa) is <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule">just a few days away</a>.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>If everything goes well, the next part in this series will go through setting
up Ubuntu 20.04 on the MicroServer.</p>
