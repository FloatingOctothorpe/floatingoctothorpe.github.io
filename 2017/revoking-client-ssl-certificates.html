<h1>Revoking client SSL certificates</h1>

<time datetime="2017-10-13">13 October 2017</time>

<p>Following on from <a href="/2017/client-ssl-certificate-authentication-with-apache.html">last weeks post</a>, this post is going to look
at revoking client SSL certificates to invalidate them.</p>
<h2>Why revoke certificates?</h2>
<p>When certificates are used for client authentication, the private key is kept
on the users device to decrypt messages and the public key is sent to the
server. So if Alice wants to connect to Bob's server she will send her X.509
certificate as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake">TLS handshake</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing a user, Alice, talking to a server run by Bob with a
certificate." src="/2017/client-x509-auth-diagram.svg"></p>
<p>It is important that the private key remains confidential. If the key is
compromised, the third party will be able to use the key to impersonate the
user. For example if Mallory made a copy of Alice's private key she could use
this to authenticate with Bob's server:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing an attacker, Mallory using Alice's
key." src="/2017/client-x509-compromised-auth-diagram.svg"></p>
<p>Once a private key is compromised any certificates associated with that key
should be revoked to ensure they can no longer be used to authenticate. In the
example above Bob could revoke Alice's original certificate, and then issue a
new certificate to Alice. This will prevent Mallory using the original
certificate to authenticate as Alice.</p>
<h2>Creating a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)</h2>
<p>Start by creating a <code>clrnumber</code> file. Like the <code>serial</code> file, this file is used
to add a monotonically increasing sequence number to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL
certificates</a> as they are generated:</p>
<pre><code>echo 1000 &gt; /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crlnumber
</code></pre>
<p>A CRL certificate can then be generated using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>openssl ca \
  -config /etc/httpd/conf/ca/openssl.cnf \
  -gencrl \
  -out /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crl.pem
</code></pre>
<p>The new certificate file will initially state that no certificates have been
revoked:</p>
<pre><code>$ openssl crl -in /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crl.pem -noout -text
Certificate Revocation List (CRL):
        Version 2 (0x1)
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: /C=GB/ST=England/O=Alice Ltd/OU=Alice Ltd Certificate Authority/CN=Alice Ltd Root CA
        Last Update: Oct  8 17:27:12 2017 GMT
        Next Update: Nov  7 17:27:12 2017 GMT
        CRL extensions:
            X509v3 CRL Number:
                4096
No Revoked Certificates.
</code></pre>
<p>To revoke a certificate, a command similar to the following can be used:</p>
<pre><code>openssl ca \
  -config /etc/httpd/conf/ca/openssl.cnf \
  -revoke /etc/httpd/conf/ca/newcerts/1000.pem
</code></pre>
<p>Finally a new CRL certificate can be generated:</p>
<pre><code>openssl ca \
  -config /etc/httpd/conf/ca/openssl.cnf \
  -gencrl \
  -out /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crl.pem
</code></pre>
<p>The certificate will now be listed as revoked:</p>
<pre><code>$ openssl crl -in /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crl.pem -noout -text
...
Revoked Certificates:
    Serial Number: 1000
        Revocation Date: Oct  8 17:36:38 2017 GMT
</code></pre>
<h2>Updating Apache</h2>
<p>By default Apache will not look at the CRL certificate. As a result revoked
certificates can still be used to authenticate! To correct this add the
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcarevocationfile">SSLCARevocationFile</a> and
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcarevocationcheck">SSLCARevocationCheck</a> directives to
<code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>SSLCARevocationFile /etc/httpd/conf/ca/crl.pem
SSLCARevocationCheck chain
</code></pre>
<p>Then restart Apache to pick up the configuration change:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl restart httpd.service
</code></pre>
<p>Apache should now reject authentication attempts which are made using revoked
certificates:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl  \
  --insecure \
  --cert /etc/httpd/conf/users/alice/cert.pem \
  --key /e tc/httpd/conf/users/alice/key.pem \
  https://localhost/test.txt
curl: (58) SSL peer rejected your certificate as revoked.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if a new CRL certificate is issued, Apache needs to be restarted to
pick up the change!</p>
<h2>Other security measures</h2>
<p>As well as checking for revoked certificates, below are a few security related
points you should consider when using client certificate authentication:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The certificate authority should ideally be hosted on a different server.
   This prevents the CA being compromised if the server running Apache is
   compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a passphrase to both client and CA private keys. This can be done with
   the following command:</p>
<pre><code>openssl rsa -aes256 -in key.pem -out key_encrypted.pem
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider using an intermediate CA and storing the private key for the root
   CA offline. For more information on setting up an OpenSSL CA have a look at
   the <a href="https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/">OpenSSL certificate authority guide</a> by Jamie
   Nguyen.</p>
