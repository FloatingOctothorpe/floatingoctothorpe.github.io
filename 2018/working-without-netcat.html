<h1>Working without Netcat</h1>

<time datetime="2018-01-05">05 January 2018</time>

<p>Netcat is a great command line tool for working with TCP or UDP connections, in
a <a href="/2017/netcat-tricks-and-tips.html">previous post</a> I went over a few Netcat tips and tricks.
Unfortunately Netcat is often not available by default. This post is going to
look at a few alternatives for situations where it's not possible to install
Netcat.</p>
<h2>Python and sockets</h2>
<p>A number of fairly fundamental tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Dog_Updater,_Modified">Yum</a> are build on top
of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. As a result Python is often available on Linux based
systems. Python's standard library is fairly extensive and includes a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html">socket
module</a>. Carrying out simple tasks using the module is
fairly straightforward, for example if you wanted to test a TCP connection you
could use code similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function

import socket

socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)

client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
    client.connect(('example.com', 22))
    client.close()
    print('Connection successful')
except socket.error as e:
    print(e)
    exit(1)
</code></pre>
<p>There are also several re-implementations of Netcat written in Python, for
example <a href="https://github.com/NullArray/PyCat/">PyCat</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/obfusk/netcat.py">netcat.py</a>. <code>netcat.py</code> is particularly useful
because it can be used without installing any additional dependencies.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obfusk/netcat.py/master/netcat.py
$ python netcat.py -v localhost 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1
</code></pre>
<h2>Perl</h2>
<p>Like Python, <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> is often installed on Linux systems and comes
with a socket library (<a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/IO/Socket/INET.html">IO::Socket::INET</a>). A very simple TCP
listener script might look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl

use warnings;
use strict;

use IO::Socket::INET;

# Autoflush stdout
$| = 1;

my $listener = new IO::Socket::INET (Listen    =&gt; 1,
                                     LocalAddr =&gt; '0.0.0.0',
                                     LocalPort =&gt; '1234',
                                     Proto     =&gt; 'tcp');

my $client_socket = $listener-&gt;accept();

while (1) {
  my $data = "";
  $client_socket-&gt;recv($data, 1024);
  print "$data";
  if ($data eq "") {
    last;
  }
}
shutdown($client_socket, 1);
</code></pre>
<h2>/dev/tcp and /dev/udp</h2>
<p>It's actually possible to open TCP or UDP connections using bash. This is
briefly mentioned in the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html">man page for bash</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bash</strong> handles several filenames specially when they are used in
redirections, as described in the following table.  If the operating system
on which <strong>bash</strong> is running provides these special files, bash will use
them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with the behavior described
below.</p>
<p><strong>/dev/tcp/host/port</strong></p>
<p>If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port
number or service name, <strong>bash</strong> attempts to open a TCP connection to the
corresponding socket.</p>
<p><strong>/dev/udp/host/port</strong></p>
<p>If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port
number or service name, <strong>bash</strong> attempts to open a UDP connection to the
corresponding socket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this feature is relatively straightforward. For example, if you wanted to
connect to <code>time.nist.gov</code> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Protocol">Daytime Protocol</a>,
you could do the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &lt; /dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13

58123 18-01-05 07:55:00 00 0 0 923.6 UTC(NIST) *
</code></pre>
<p>It's also possible to make simple HTTP requests, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ exec 3&lt;&gt;/dev/tcp/example.com/80
$ echo -e 'GET / HTTP/1.1\nhost: example.com\n' &gt;&amp;3
$ cat &lt;&amp;3
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Content-Type: text/html
...
</code></pre>
<h2>Telnet</h2>
<p>While the telnet protocol is not strictly the same as a plain TCP connection,
it's often similar enough to allow you to use the telnet client for other
protocols, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ telnet time.nist.gov 13
Trying 132.163.96.1...
Connected to time.nist.gov.
Escape character is '^]'.

58123 18-01-05 08:06:58 00 0 0  49.1 UTC(NIST) *
Connection closed by foreign host.
</code></pre>
<h2>Powershell</h2>
<p>Modern Windows systems normally have Powershell available. This makes it easy
to call the .NET <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.aspx">TcpClient Class</a> directly. For example
if you wanted to verify you can connect to <code>example.com:80</code> you could do the
following:</p>
<pre><code>PS &gt; $connection = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient('example.com', 80)
PS &gt; $connection.Connected
True
PS &gt; $connection.close()
</code></pre>
<h2>Abusing curl</h2>
<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> can be used to quickly verify if a port is open. Although
this method is far from ideal for non-http protocols such as SSH, it's often
sufficient to verify a TCP connection can be established:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --verbose --user-agent '' --max-time 1 -i localhost:22
* About to connect() to localhost port 22 (#0)
*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 22 (#0)
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: localhost:22
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1
Protocol mismatch.
* Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
* Closing connection 0
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: HTTP headers will be sent to the target which is often undesirable.</p>
