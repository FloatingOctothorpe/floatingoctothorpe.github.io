<h1>Caching DNS queries with Unbound</h1>

<time datetime="2018-05-11">11 May 2018</time>

<p>By default on Linux distributions like <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, if a process
needs to resolve a hostname it will query a remote name server. The IP address
of the name server(s) which is queried is controlled by
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/resolv.conf.5.html">/etc/resolv.conf</a>. While this process is very
straightforward, it does mean if the same address is queried multiple times,
the system will have to send multiple DNS queries over the network. This post
is going to look at configuring <a href="https://unbound.net/">Unbound</a> to act as a local DNS
cache.</p>
<h2>Caching requests</h2>
<p>When a process calls a function like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a>, a query
is sent via the network:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing a standard DNS query" src="/2018/dns-query-diagram.svg"></p>
<p>Instead of the process making the call directly to the remote name server,
traffic can initially be sent to Unbound. Unbound will then forward the request
on to a remote server:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing Unbound forwarding a DNS
query" src="/2018/unbound-forwarding-dns-query-diagram.svg"></p>
<p>However once Unbound received a reply it can cache the response. Subsequent
requests can then be answered using the cached answer:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing Unbound using a cached DNS
query" src="/2018/unbound-cached-dns-query-diagram.svg"></p>
<p>This does add some additional complexity, however the cached responses will
avoid network latency and should therefore be quicker:</p>
<pre><code>$ time host example.com 1.1.1.1
Using domain server:
Name: 1.1.1.1
Address: 1.1.1.1#53
Aliases:

example.com has address 93.184.216.34
example.com has IPv6 address 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946

real    0m0.093s
user    0m0.007s
sys     0m0.008s

$ time host example.com 127.0.0.1
Using domain server:
Name: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Aliases:

example.com has address 93.184.216.34
example.com has IPv6 address 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946

real    0m0.018s
user    0m0.012s
sys     0m0.005s
</code></pre>
<p>Using a cache for DNS queries is also helpful if the connection to a remote
name server is unreliable, as cached requests do not depend on the network.</p>
<h2>Setting up Unbound</h2>
<p>On CentOS 7 Unbound can be installed using <code>yum</code></p>
<pre><code>yum install -y unbound bind-utils
</code></pre>
<p>Once Unbound is installed, the remote name server(s) to forward DNS queries to
can be set with configuration similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 1.1.1.1
        forward-addr: 1.0.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration will tell Unbound to forward all DNS queries onto
<a href="https://1.1.1.1/">Cloudflare's public DNS servers</a>. The configuration can either
be added to the main configuration file, <code>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf</code>, or to an
additional config file under <code>/etc/unbound/conf.d/</code>. You may also want to set
additional options such as <code>cache-max-ttl</code>. Information on additional options
can be found in the <a href="https://unbound.net/documentation/unbound.conf.html">unbound.conf man page</a>.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with the configuration, enable and start the Unbound service:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable unbound
systemctl start unbound
</code></pre>
<p>If everything goes well you should be able to query the Unbound server:</p>
<pre><code>$ host example.com 127.0.0.1
Using domain server:
Name: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Aliases:

example.com has address 93.184.216.34
example.com has IPv6 address 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <a href="https://unbound.net/documentation/unbound-control.html">unbound-control</a> command to verify
Unbound is forwarding queries on to the correct name server(s):</p>
<pre><code>$ unbound-control lookup example.com
The following name servers are used for lookup of example.com.
forwarding request:
Delegation with 0 names, of which 0 can be examined to query further addresses.
It provides 2 IP addresses.
1.1.1.1                 rto 147 msec, ttl 144, ping 19 var 32 rtt 147, tA 0, tAAAA 0, tother 0, EDNS 0 probed.
1.0.0.1                 rto 194 msec, ttl 144, ping 10 var 46 rtt 194, tA 0, tAAAA 0, tother 0, EDNS 0 probed.
</code></pre>
<p>Once you're happy Unbound is functioning correctly, <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> can be
updated to point at <code>127.0.0.1</code> with configuration similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>nameserver 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> has been generated by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a>, it will be overwritten when the network
is restarted. To get around this the NetworkManager configuration can be
updated with commands similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>nmcli connection modify System\ enp0s3 ipv4.dns 127.0.0.1
nmcli connection modify System\ enp0s3 ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
</code></pre>
<h2>Allowing remote queries</h2>
<p>By default Unbound will only accept DNS queries on a local interface. It is
however fairly straightforward to allow remote queries, this can be done with
the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code>server:
        interface: 0.0.0.0
        access-control: 10.0.0.0/8 allow
</code></pre>
<p>This will tell Unbound to listen on any IPv4 interface, and allow remote
queries from the <code>10.0.0.0/8</code> subnet.</p>
