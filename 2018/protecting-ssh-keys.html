<h1>Protecting SSH keys</h1>

<time datetime="2018-06-08">08 June 2018</time>

<p>Public/private Keys are a great way to handle authentication when working with
SSH, however public-key cryptography relies on you keeping your private key
private. There are a few ways you can achieve this when working with
<a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>.</p>

<h2>File permissions</h2>

<p>Private key files should never be world readable, the parent directory should
also be restricted to prevent anyone other than the owner accessing the files
in the directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -ld ~/.ssh/ ~/.ssh/id_rsa
drwx------. 2 bob bob   38 Jun  6 22:27 /home/bob/.ssh/
-rw-------. 1 bob bob 1679 Jun  6 22:27 /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>If for any reason your private key has read access for group or other, you will
probably get a message similar to the following when trying to use the key:</p>

<pre><code>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0664 for '/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.
</code></pre>

<p>File permissions can be restricted with <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ chmod -v 0700 ~/.ssh/ ; chmod -v 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
mode of '/home/bob/.ssh/' retained as 0700 (rwx------)
mode of '/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa' changed from 0664 (rw-rw-r--) to 0600 (rw-------)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: As well as thinking about file permissions on the key, you should
also consider file permissions on disk backups.</p>

<h2>Adding a passphrase</h2>

<p>Setting restrictive file permissions is a good start, however if someone does
manage to get read access to your key, they will be able to use it unless it's
encrypted with a passphrase.</p>

<h3>Setting a passphrase</h3>

<p>When you create a new public/private key pair with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen</a> you will normally be prompted for a passphrase:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you already have a private key you can encrypt the key with a
passphrase using the <code>-p</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Key has comment '/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa'
Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</code></pre>

<p>When doing this it's important to think about the complexity of the passphrase.
If you use a simple passphrase, an attacker could easily guess the passphrase
and unlock the key, assuming they have read access to the key in the first
place. The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen man page</a> has the following advice on
picking a passphrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or
  otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per
  character, and provides very bad passphrases), and contain a mix of upper and
  lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as picking a good passphrase, it's also important to consider which key
format you want to use.</p>

<h3>Cracking passphrases and private key formats</h3>

<p>Tools such as <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> can be used to try to brute force a
passphrase. This involves two steps, the first step is to extract the hash
using <code>ssh2john</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./ssh2john.py /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa &gt; id_rsa.hash
</code></pre>

<p>Once the hash has been extracted, <code>john</code> can be used to try to brute force the
passphrase:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./john id_rsa.hash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
</code></pre>

<p>After loading the hash <code>john</code> will start to guess the passphrase. At
the time of writing the default encryption algorithum for SSH keys is
<code>MD5/3DES</code>. With a single CPU core <code>john</code> is able to make just under one
million guesses per second:</p>

<pre><code>0g 0:00:00:20  3/3 0g/s 899538p/s 899538c/s 899538C/s berete1
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make an attacker's life difficult you should consider using the
new private key format which was introduced in <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.5">OpenSSH
6.4</a>. This key format uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a>
KDF to protect the key which is significantly slower to brute force. Using
<code>john</code> on the same CPU I was only able to make just over 7 guesses per second:</p>

<pre><code>0g 0:00:00:07  1/3 0g/s 7.627p/s 7.627c/s 7.627C/s rsaid
</code></pre>

<p>You can switch your key to the new format with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -o -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <code>-a</code> option can also be used to specify how many rounds should be
used.</p>

<h2>Rotating keys</h2>

<p>The last thing to consider is rotating your keys. This effectively boils down
to the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a new private key.</li>
<li>Copy the corresponding public key to each remote location you want to
authenticate with.</li>
<li>Check you can access each location using your new private key.</li>
<li>Remove your old public key from all remote locations.</li>
<li>Finally remove your private key.</li>
</ol>

<p>How easy or difficult this will be depends on how many different places you've
setup your public key. A very simple example might look something like the
following:</p>

<pre><code># Generate a new private key
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new

# Copy your new public key to the remote hosts
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new remote-box

# Verify you can use the new key to login
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new remote-box hostname

# Remove the old public key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new remote-box 'sed -i "/O1qPS18Ni8F8GqZ0yEjzp665tTPR9F/d" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

# Delete and replace the old key
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new ~/.ssh/id_rsa
mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
